 List Methods
Consider the following list:

  L1 = [1, 8, 7, 2, 21, 15]
sort() – updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
reverse() – updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
append(8) – adds 8 at the end of the list
insert(3,8) – This will add 8 at 3 index
pop(2) – It will delete the element at index 2 and return its value
# remove(21) – It will remove 21 from the last
